# OVMS Android App Latest Builds

These APK files are the builds of the latest development state as published here. To learn
about the changes since the last public release (i.e. Google Play), check out the
[commit history](https://github.com/openvehicles/Open-Vehicle-Android/commits/master).

The APK files are signed with the official OVMS key, so can be installed on top of a Google
Play release (and vice versa) without losing any data or configuration.

You can normally install the "release" build, that will offer the same performance as the public
Google Play release. The "debug" build is meant to be used if you want to help in debugging any
issues by retrieving the debug logs. It will run a little bit slower, but still be perfectly usable
on all current devices.
